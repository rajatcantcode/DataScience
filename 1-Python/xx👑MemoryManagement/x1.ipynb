    "# ðŸ§  Memory Management Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing memory efficiently is crucial for writing optimal Python code. Here are some best practices to help you handle memory effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Local Variables**:  \n",
    "   Local variables are created within functions and have a shorter lifespan. They are automatically freed when the function ends, which helps in saving memory.  \n",
    "   <span style=\"color: green;\">*Summary: Prefer using local variables inside functions instead of global variables whenever possible.*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoid Circular References**:  \n",
    "   Circular references occur when two or more objects reference each other, creating a loop that prevents their memory from being freed. This can lead to **memory leaks**.  \n",
    "   <span style=\"color: red;\">*Problem: Circular references can keep objects in memory longer than necessary.*</span>  \n",
    "   <span style=\"color: green;\">*Solution: Be mindful of object references and use weak references (via the `weakref` module) to prevent this.*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Generators**:  \n",
    "   Generators produce items one at a time instead of creating the entire collection in memory. This makes them highly memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets.  \n",
    "   <span style=\"color: green;\">*Summary: Use generators (created with `yield` keyword) to process large data streams or perform iterative computations.*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explicitly Delete Objects**:  \n",
    "   Use the `del` statement to delete variables and objects when they are no longer needed. This helps the garbage collector to free up memory faster.  \n",
    "   <span style=\"color: green;\">*Example: `del my_variable` removes `my_variable` from memory.*</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Profile Memory Usage**:  \n",
    "   Use memory profiling tools like `tracemalloc` and `memory_profiler` to monitor and optimize memory usage in your programs. These tools can help identify memory leaks and areas that need improvement.  \n",
    "   <span style=\"color: green;\">*Summary: Regularly profile your application's memory usage to ensure efficient memory management.*</span>\n"
